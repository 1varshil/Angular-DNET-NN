Dapper is Basically Connecting The Queries With The Db Using SQL 

 SO Basically For Performance Issue WIth Entity We Use Teh Dapper -> In Entity LinQ Queries Were there 
 
 Dapper is Safe From SQL Injection
 
 Performance Wise Dapper Is Best
 
 Dapper Is a Nuget Library Can be USed In Any .net Project 
 
 For an Existing Db ., USing Dapper is a optimal Choice 
 
 so In Repository We use Basically This Methods :
 
 1). QueryAsync : Query Execute and List Return in Asyncronous Manner and Retrieve Multiple Rows 
 
 2). QueryFirstAsync : Return the first Result of the Query if Not Found than It Will Gives Error 
 
 3).QueryFirstOrDefaultAsync : Basically Return the First Result and if not found then returns the Default (T)
								not Return the Exception
								
 4). QuerySingleAsync : - Basically It Returns The First Row Only if More than That it will
							throw an error 
						We use This Method When We Require only Single Row as Result 
						
 5). ExecuteAsync : - Basically It Will Execute the Non-Query Statements Like ex: Insert,Update,Delete
